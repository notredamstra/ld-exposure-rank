# Ludum Dare Exposure Rank
> Simple webpage that allows Ludum Dare contestants to retrieve their entry's exposure rank (= based on number of ratings). 

The Ludum Dare website has a sorting filter based on number of ratings, but doesn't show you your current rank, and manually counting hundreds of search results is not a fun thing to do. That's how I came up with this little project. The reason it's written in Go is because I needed an excuse to try it out.
